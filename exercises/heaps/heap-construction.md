# 🏗 Heap Construction Exercise

## 🎯 Objective
In this exercise, you will insert a series of numbers into a **Max-Heap** one by one. After each insertion, you must maintain the **heap property** by applying the appropriate swaps. Once all elements have been inserted and the heap is built, you will then **remove the root element** (24) and re-heapify to restore the heap structure. You will visualize the heap at each step of insertion and removal.

## 📥 Input:
Insert the following numbers into the heap in order:  
(15, 10, 3, 8, 12, 9, 4, 1, 24)

Once you're done inserting all the elements, **remove the root (24)** from the heap and adjust the heap accordingly.
