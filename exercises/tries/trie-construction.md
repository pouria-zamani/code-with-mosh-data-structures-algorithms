# 🏗 Trie Construction Exercise

## 🎯 Objective
In this exercise, you will construct a **Trie (Prefix Tree)** from a given list of words. The goal is to insert each word character-by-character into the Trie, ensuring that common prefixes are shared among words. Once all words are inserted, you will visualize the structure of the Trie to show how prefixes are organized.

## 📥 Input:
You will be given the following list of words:  
**boy, book, border, cat, dog, doctor, fine, finest, figure, pick, pickle, picture**

Insert each word into the Trie, one character at a time, reusing nodes where appropriate based on common prefixes.
