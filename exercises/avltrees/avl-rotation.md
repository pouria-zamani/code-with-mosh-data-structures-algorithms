# ðŸ”„ AVL Tree Rotation Exercise

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
In this exercise, you will construct an **AVL Tree** by inserting a given set of numbers one by one. After each insertion, you will check if the tree remains balanced. If it becomes unbalanced, perform the necessary **rotations** to restore balance. You will also visualize the tree at each step and specify the type of rotations applied.

## ðŸ“¥ Input:
You will be given the following sets of numbers. For each set, start with an **empty AVL Tree**, insert the numbers in order, and re-balance the tree as needed.

### **Set 1:**  
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

### **Set 2:**  
(5, 10, 3, 12, 15, 14)

### **Set 3:**  
(12, 3, 9, 4, 6, 2)

## ðŸŒ³ AVL Tree Rotations:

Below is the visual representation of the AVL Tree at each step, including necessary rotations:

At each step, identify and apply the required **rotations**:
- **Right Rotation (RR)**
- **Left Rotation (LL)**
- **Left-Right Rotation (LR)**
- **Right-Left Rotation (RL)**
